# Personal-Website
* This one of my first projects. It's a simple **HTML/CSS website** to show my educational background, experiences and some fun facts about myself. 

**Check the live version here: https://minghsiehlo.github.io/Personal-Website/**

## General info

* This project was created using only **HTML**, **CSS** and some **media queries** to create a responsive interface. I'm proud of it as a **first version**.
However, I want to be able to show my portfolio in a better way, so I'll remake and improve it. Maybe with the help of React.js. :triumph:

* The contact form is not working right now, but you can contact me throught **LinkedIn**. :blush:
